Creating a Class, Creating an Object, and Creating Multiple Objects in Java
Project Abstract
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the creation of a class, the creation of objects from that class, and the creation of multiple objects in Java. A class in Java is a blueprint for objects, and objects are instances of a class. This project focuses on teaching learners how to:

Define a class with properties and methods.
Create objects from the class and initialize their properties.
Handle multiple objects from a single class and manipulate them.
By the end of the project, participants will understand:

How to define a class in Java.
How to create objects from a class and initialize them.
How to create and manage multiple objects of the same class.
How to call methods on objects and use them effectively.
Tasks Overview
Task 1: Create a Class
Objective: Create a class called Car that has attributes and a method to display the details of a car.

Detailed Description: In this task, you are required to define a class named Car. The class will have two properties: model (String) and year (int). Additionally, it will have a constructor to initialize these properties and a method displayDetails() to display the car's model and year.

Steps:

Define a class named Car.
Define properties: model and year.
Define a constructor that accepts model and year as arguments and initializes the class properties.
Define a displayDetails() method to print the car's model and year.
Task 2: Create an Object
Objective: Create an object from the Car class and display its details using the displayDetails() method.

Detailed Description: In this task, you will create an object of the Car class and display its properties using the displayDetails() method. The Car object will be initialized with specific values for model and year.

Steps:

Instantiate an object car1 of the Car class using the new keyword.
Pass values to the constructor for model and year (e.g., "Toyota" and 2020).
Call the displayDetails() method on car1 to display its properties.
Task 3: Create Multiple Objects
Objective: Create multiple objects from the Car class and display their details.

Detailed Description: In this task, you will create multiple objects from the Car class and display their details using the displayDetails() method. Each object will have different values for model and year.

Steps:

Instantiate additional objects car2 and car3 of the Car class with different values for model and year (e.g., "Honda" and 2018, "Ford" and 2022).
Call the displayDetails() method for each object to display their respective details.
